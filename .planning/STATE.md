## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Data layer before server before skills — driven by component dependency graph; this order is a technical requirement, not a preference
- Roadmap: RLS policies written in same migration as table creation — cannot be retrofitted safely after user data exists
- Roadmap: Streamable HTTP transport (not stdio) — MCP server must be remote because user data lives in hosted Supabase

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- API key issuance infrastructure (Stripe → key generation → key delivery) is out-of-band and must be planned before launch; not covered in any phase
- Billing infrastructure (subscription management, key provisioning on payment) needs separate planning before launch
